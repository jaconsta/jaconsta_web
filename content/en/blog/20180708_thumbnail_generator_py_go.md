Recently I was asked to build a site for some artists to show their work.

There where two main intentions for it: To show their work and try to sell them.

It had no requirements for user interactions among other details, I decided to go for the fastest method to build it and
that I could maintain it; I used a _static site generator_.

And it was published fast: 6 hours between starting the project and watch it published with some procratinastion in the middle. 

Of course 90% of it are images. And when I saw it published, the home page took almost a minute to load, and the main reason was
the images original size.
