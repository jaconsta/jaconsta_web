Stop getting yourself into eternal queues. Wait how you please with Catena.

And provide the same pleasure to your customers.

## As a business manager

Connect to a web dashboard application.
Add your agents who offer your services and visualize different metrics
on how the queue performs over time. That will allow you to make efficient
decisions on how to improve your customers satisfaction from the moment they
enter your establishment.

And if you work on the web... it can be used to notify your users they best
moment to connect.

## As a customer

Claim the company to use **catena** to ease your waiting times on the queue.

Download the Mobile app (iOS and Android) register to the company or
establishment and request a turn.

Then instead of waiting for your turn to come. You can go have a coffee or go
to another place with **catena** and request a new turn. You are free to
manage your waiting time as you wish, you aren't forced to just wait.
