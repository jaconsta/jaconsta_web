One word... Sprinkle the world.

Let's make it possible that everyone can have plants at their homes.

And make possible for the vast lands and crops to be watered
and harvested efficiently.

The system provides IOT connected devices to water your plants and measure
their environment so you can monitor and guarantee the land is always at the
optimum hydration point.

You can access a dashboard to review how the system works and configure your
connected devices.
